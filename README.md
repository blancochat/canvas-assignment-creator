- **Reduced Clutter**: Clean interface with relevant courses only
- **Semester Management**: Easy to update as terms change

#### Troubleshooting Course Selection
- **No Favorites Set**: Script automatically shows all active courses

- **Old Courses Showing**: Update your favorites in Canvas web interface
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure you have instructor/TA permissions

## Configuration Files

### Location
- **Config Directory**: `~/.canvas-config/`
- **Main Config**: `~/.canvas-config/config`
- **Course Cache**: `~/.canvas-config/courses_cache`
- **Log File**: `~/.canvas-config/canvas-assign.log`

### Manual Configuration

If needed, you can manually edit the config file:

```bash
# ~/.canvas-config/config
CANVAS_URL=https://your-institution.instructure.com
API_TOKEN=your_api_token_here
```

**Note:** The config file has restrictive permissions (600) for security.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Missing required dependencies"**
- Install curl and jq using your system's package manager
- See installation instructions above

**"API connection failed"**  
- Verify your Canvas URL is correct
- Check that your API token is valid and not expired
- Ensure you have network connectivity
- Try running with `--verbose` for detailed error messages

**"No active courses found"**
- Verify you're enrolled in courses for the current term
- Check that courses are published and active
- Try refreshing the course list

**"Permission denied errors"**
- Ensure you have instructor or TA permissions in the selected course
- Verify your API token has necessary scopes

### Verbose Logging

Enable detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```bash
./canvas-assign-creator.sh --verbose
```

This creates detailed logs in `~/.canvas-config/canvas-assign.log`

### Reset Configuration

If you encounter persistent issues:

```bash
./canvas-assign-creator.sh --reset-config
```

This clears all saved settings and forces reconfiguration.

## Security Considerations

- **API tokens are stored securely** with restricted file permissions
- **No tokens are logged** or displayed in plain text  
- **Input validation** prevents injection attacks
- **HTTPS connections** ensure encrypted communication
- **No sensitive data** is cached inappropriately

## Canvas API Rate Limits

The script respects Canvas API rate limits:
- **Default limit**: 700 requests per hour per token
- **Automatic retry** with exponential backoff on rate limit errors
- **Efficient caching** to minimize API calls
